## 1. BUSINESS PROBLEMS

Eduardo and Marcelo are two Brazilians, friends and business partners. After several successful business, they are planning to enter the US fashion market as a E-commerce business model.

The initial idea is to enter the market with just one product and for a specific audience, in the case the product would be Jenas pants for the male audience. The objective is to keep the cost of operation down and scale as they get customers.

However, even with the entry product and audience defined, the two partners lack experience in this fashion market and therefore don't know how to define basic things like price, the type of pants and the material for the manufacture of each part.


 ### 1.1 **Context:**
 
 * Thus, the two partners hired a Data Science consultancy to answer the following questions:
      * Questions:
           * **1. What is the best selling price for the pants?**
           * **2. How many types of pants and their colors for the initial product?**
           * **3. What raw materials are needed to make the pants?**

## 2. BUSINESS ASSUMPTIONS

The motivation lies in knowing the behavior of the prices of men's jeans from the two main competitors of Star Jeans.

**Mainly competitors:**
